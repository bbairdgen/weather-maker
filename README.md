# Weather Maker

## Description

I created this site in order to help me learn how to incorporate APIs and API keys. This was used to help me the right functions. I was able to learn how to create API keys, use the async/await functions, and how to create buttons from the local storage items. 

## Installation

N/A 

## Usage

To use this site, you need to visit (https://bbairdgen.github.io/weather-maker). 

When using this site, you can only search by city name. There are some bugs that do not allow for you to input the state or country in the search. This is something I would like to add later.

## Credits

To create this project, I worked with the TAs from my Boot Camp and the tutor Alistair. 

The API being used is from OpenWeatherMap. 

I also watched a tutorial on using OpenWeatherMap found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGVoHEZojiQ)
